## About

This project originally started as an attempt to improve the NCTH performance in the base 1.13 mod by re-balancing the items and adding a couple of new items/features. However integration into stock 1.13 without interfering with OCTH/different balancing approaches proved too difficult, so it grew into a own separate mod instead.
By now other aspects like maps and pre-placed loot were extensively modified, so it can be seen as a further development of the stock 1.13 mod, which mainly serves "just" as a new feature dump today.

However if you are looking for an extensive item mod with hundreds of new items you won't likely get happy with it, as only a relatively small number of genuinely new items was added. The general policy is to add more only in small doses, if they help improving the game balance or to flesh out new features.
